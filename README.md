# Welcome to Location Snitch

Hi! I'm an app that tracks your location and posts it to a server you provide.

# Requirements

You need a webserver listening on https, with a certificate trusted by webkit.
You need some coding experience depending on what you want to accomplish.


# Preparations

- Any webserver and language you are familiar with.
- A script that can retrieve POST requests

# How to use.

- Preparations
- Step 1 Install the App from app store, see link.
- Step 2 Open the App and allow location trace "Always"
- Step 3 Enter a device name -> will be variable device
- Step 4 Enter a url in format https://server.tld/path/script


## Examples for use cases

Lets say you are a consultant who travels between your office and 3-4 clients a day, and wanted a easier way to measure how much time you spend on each client. Then this app with a web service could let you have access to that data.

## Example files

See folder examples.

### Privacy

Since the server is provided by you, you are responsible for your own privcay, nifty ey.
